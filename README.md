# TuneYourPrompt

A mobile-optimized website designed to teach people how to craft effective AI prompts using the Metis model.

## Overview

TuneYourPrompt is a lightweight, accessible tool for anyone to learn prompting on the goâ€”no app download needed, just a browser. It provides a three-step workflow to help users improve their AI prompting skills:

1. **Define Your Goal** - Users specify their expected output
2. **Write Your Prompt** - Users craft a prompt to achieve that output
3. **Get Feedback** - The site evaluates the AI's response and provides improvement tips

## Features

- **Scoring System**: Match percentage showing how close the AI output is to the expected result
- **Feedback Breakdown**: Analysis of clarity, detail, and relevance
- **AI-Driven Suggestions**: Recommendations for better prompts
- **Mobile-First Design**: Clean, simple interface optimized for small screens
- **Modern UI**: Dark theme with futuristic design elements

## Technical Setup

- **Backend**: Node.js Express server connecting to an AI API
- **Evaluation**: Uses text-similarity metrics and rule-based checks
- **Frontend**: Lightweight HTML/CSS/JS responsive site

## Getting Started
